*<p align=center>* ![Video description: A gif, featuring a black background with many small, colorful neon stars. The stars are not full shapes, only outlines. They all drift slowly downwards, at a 45 degree angle. They pop into sight and fade out. They all spin, either quickly or slowly, while changing color over the course of their time in view. They are of varying sizes, some bigger while others are much smaller. There is a sort of depth to the gif, as there appear to be multiple layers, with some sorts being farther away from the camera.

*<p align=center>* **__Do not try to friend me if we didn't talk beforehand, I will not accept it.__**

*<p align=center>* The most basic DNI I have is basic [DNI](https://dni-criteria.carrd.co/) criteria. If I'm on the safe server, minors limit interaction unless friends/we share a party.<sup> I will be friendly if you compliment me but I am not really looking to make friends with y'all. I am an adult!</sup> 

*<p align=center>* I will block any proship/profic on sight! I will not insult you or tell you to die, but I *do **not*** want to interact with you. Also spitting on me or my friends will earn you an immediate, very unkind fuck off and a permanent block if you are a stranger. For the rest of my DNI, please visit my full dni on either of my sites listed.

### *<p align=center>* *I am a singlet frequently surrounded by systems! I am very protective of them. If you hate systems, or try to start shit with my friends, I **<ins>will</ins>** eat you.*
### *<p align=center>* *Btw I'm including putting systems in your dni, especially if you're a singlet. idgaf about your reasoning. I too am forgetful. No this is not directed at systems, <ins>unless</ins> your reasoning for not wanting other systems to interact has the implication/direct statement that other systems on here are fake. I'll block you if I spot you.*

### *<p align=center>* *I actually sincerely cannot believe I have to say this but don't act like you are the deciding force and can simply Tell who does and doesn't have certain illnesses. Stop fakeclaiming others online, or I'm gonna beat you over the head with rocks.*
