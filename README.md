# *<p align=center>* **Hey there! || IDWT(IJWD) stands for I don't wanna talk (I just wanna dance) !! It's one of my favorite songs by Glass Animals. || *Pub chat off, whisp 2 int!!***

### ***<p align=center>Welcome to my github. There's nothing super important here, tbh. But here's a short intro rq.***

---


*<p align=center>* I'm Chrissy, I'm 21, I go by [she](https://en.pronouns.page/@Chrissybeans)[^1]//[her](https://pronouns.cc/@Chrispybeans)[^2] pronouns. Any are probably okay, but I'm not sure yet. I'm demiaroace/pan. Taken by My Cowboy (QPR <3)

<p align=center> .
  
<p align=center> I am single handedly keeping the Deltarune side of the UT/DR area alive /hj

<p align=center> I'm most often offtab or not paying attention, so whisp to interact / get my attention most of the time. My status is always set to away! You gotta try interacting to see if I'm there. Also I make frequent use of tonetags as you can see. If you genuinely want me to not use them, you gotta tell me, and my memory is bad so you may have to remind me more than once, sorry.

<p align=center> .

<p align=center> If I'm ever seen cuddling/nuzzling/kissing someone, it's always platonic/friendly unless it's with my partner! (the nature of our affection is beyond your comprehension. /hj)
<p align=center> Always assume that the person I may be acting affectionate with is not my partner, unless stated otherwise. My partner isn't on PT as often as I am, and they're pretty private anyways so mind your own business. (/lh)

<p align=center> .

<p align=center> Please stop eating my grapes for god's sake there is a fruit basket like right there near where I sit. /lh
<p align=center> It actually is kind of irritating in a way I can't explain. Get your own grapes, quit stealing grapes from some stranger.

<p align=center> Do not try to friend me if we didn't talk beforehand, I will not accept it.

*<p align=center>* The most basic DNI I have is basic [DNI](https://dni-criteria.carrd.co/) criteria. I will block any proship/profic on sight! I will not insult you or tell you to die, but I do not want to interact with you. ~~For the rest of my DNI, please visit my full dni on my strawpage.~~

<p align=center> I hide kind of freely. If I have you or a friend hidden, it's likely for a reason. Please understand.

>[!NOTE]
>(The strawpage is currently unavailable since that's under construction, but my other sites have DNIs listed too.)

**<p align=center> Note ahead of time: I don't mind at all if you try to int when I have dniuf in my name, just be mindful that I may not be in the mood to talk to people I don't know! *But* if you interact *solely* to mock me, don't whine about it if I tell you to fuck off. If your sole purpose is to antagonize me, I will absolutely curse you out and block you. I don't care if you think it's :sparkles:valid:sparkles: or not, seeing a boundary and choosing to push it because you personally view it as invalid is a dick move.**

### *<p align=center>* ~Please visit my strawpage if you want to learn more about me! It's the best looking site, and the text is easier to read because it's in relatively broken up chunks.~

>[!NOTE]
*~~(By the way, it's been created with my default zoom set to 80%, so things may be bigger for you than they are for me! Sorry, and thanks for understanding!)~~*
