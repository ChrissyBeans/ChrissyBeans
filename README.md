#### *<p align=center>* I genuinely cannot believe this needs explaining but for the love of god don't make it weird if me and my friends are sitting together. Not everything needs to have a romantic connotation or reasoning you freak. /dir

<p align=center> .

#### <p align=center> PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD IF YOU RECOGNIZE MY SYSTEM SHOCK AVATARS INT !!!!!! I LOVE THAT BIG MEAN AI LADY SO MUCH I'M BEGGING ON MY HANDS AND KNEES

<p align=center> .

<p align=center> I'm friendly!! I'm just awkward/shy. If you approach me kindly I will return it! And if you're friends with the people I sit with, you can C+H with me, even if I don't know you! (That being said, please don't cover me if you're not friended!) All green names are welcome to sit with me !
  
<p align=center> Even if we never talk ily green names /p

<p align=center> .

*<p align=center>* I'm really not mean at all, *except* when it comes to my friends. If you disrespect my friends right in my face **\(*especially* those in the love letters tab like Mary and Wesker)**, I can and probably will get pretty mean, especially if you directly insult them and/or spit at them repeatedly, and it will likely land in me hard blocking you. I may not be my friends but disrespect to them is disrespect to me and I do ***<ins>not</ins>*** take it kindly. Consider yourself warned.

<p align=center> .

<p align=center> by the way even if I have fandom IWC on my avatar, fellow enjoyers of the media can int! I'm just wary cuz I know there are can be weirdos or whatnot in fandoms like Sprunki +etc.

<p align=center> .

*<p align=center>* Please stop eating my fruit if I have any in general. /lh

#### <p align=center> I hide freely! Especially since way too many of you people are far too comfortable being weird or mean to others \(especially towards systems if I'm being honest... looking at you mw people). normal person beam ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ <--- also imagine ME being normal compared to you. Like actually. I'm weird at times but you mfs are a whole other level sometimes oh my god


*<p align=center>* **__Do not try to friend me if we didn't talk beforehand, I will not accept it.__**

*<p align=center>* The most basic DNI I have is basic [DNI](https://dni-criteria.carrd.co/) criteria. If I'm on the safe server, minors limit interaction unless friends/we share a party.<sup> **I will be friendly if you compliment me but I am not really looking to make friends with y'all. I am an adult!**</sup> 

*<p align=center>* I will block any proship/profic on sight! I will not insult you or tell you to die, but I *do **not*** want to interact with you. Also spitting on me or my friends will earn you an immediate, very unkind fuck off and a permanent block if you are a stranger. For the rest of my DNI, please visit my full dni on either of my sites listed.

### *<p align=center>* *I am a singlet frequently surrounded by systems! I am very protective of them. If you hate systems, automatically assume they're fake if they're on here, or try to start shit with my friends, I **<ins>will</ins>** eat you.*
### *<p align=center>* *Btw I'm including putting systems in your dni, especially if you're a singlet. idgaf about your reasoning. I too am forgetful. No this is not directed at systems, <ins>unless</ins> your reasoning for not wanting other systems to interact has the implication/direct statement that other systems on here are fake. I'll block you if I spot you. I also can't believe I have to say this but if I see you saying you'll hide every sys pony you see I'm hiding you.*

### *<p align=center>* *Also I actually sincerely cannot believe I have to say this but don't act like you are the deciding force and can simply Tell who does and doesn't have certain illnesses. Stop fakeclaiming others online or I'm gonna beat you over the head with rocks.*
