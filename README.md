# ***Hey there!***

**Welcome to my github. There's nothing super important here, tbh.**

---

Short and sweet intro rq; 

~

I'm Chrissy, I'm 21, I go by [she](https://en.pronouns.page/@Chrissybeans)/[her](https://pronouns.cc/@Chrispybeans) pronouns. Any are probably okay, but I'm not sure yet. 

((By the way, there are links to both pronouns.page and pronouns.cc there!))

.

I'm most often offtab or not paying attention, so whisp to int/get my attention most of the time. My status is always set to away! You gotta try interacting to see if I'm there.

.

Please stop eating my grapes for god's sake there is a fruit basket like right there near where I sit. /lh

And I'm sorry if I come off like a bitch, it's just irritating to look away for like a few minutes and come back to find some guy ate all the grapes right off the vine.

~

BYI, I'm often quiet! I'm also often very forgetful, and I can apologize a lot! Also, do not try to friend me without ever talking to me, I will not accept it. (Also please do not copy or inspo any of my avatars! Ask for inspo, but respect my answer if I say no!)

~

The most basic DNI I have is basic [DNI](https://dni-criteria.carrd.co/) criteria. I will block any proship/profic on sight! I will not insult you or tell you to die, but I do not want to interact with you. For the rest of my DNI, please visit my full dni on any of my sites (preferrably the strawpage).

### Please visit my strawpage if you want to learn more about me! It's the best looking site, and the text is easier to read because it's in relatively broken up chunks. 

>[!NOTE]
*(By the way, it's been created with my default zoom set to 80%, so in order for it to look right, you unfortunately have to set your zoom to 80% to read it! I also don't know how it looks on mobile! If you're on mobile, my patreon or rentry are still available to read. Sorry, and thanks for understanding!)*
