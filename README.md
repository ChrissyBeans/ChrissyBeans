# ***Hey there!***

**Welcome to my github. There's nothing super important here, tbh.**

.

Short and sweet intro rq; 

I'm Chrissy, I'm 21, I go by [she/her](https://en.pronouns.page/@Chrissybeans) pronouns. Any are probably okay, but I'm not sure yet. 

I'm most often offtab or not paying attention, so whisp to int/get my attention most of the time. My status is always set to away! You gotta try interacting to see if I'm there.

.

BYI, I'm often quiet! I'm also often very forgetful, and I can apologize a lot! Also, do not try to friend me without ever talking to me, I will not accept it. (Also please do not copy or inspo any of my avatars! Ask for inspo, but respect it if i say no!)

.

The most basic DNI I have is basic [DNI](https://dni-criteria.carrd.co/) criteria. I will block any proship/profic on sight! I will not insult you or tell you to die, but I do not want to interact with you. For the rest of my DNI, please visit my full dni on any of my sites (preferrably the strawpage).

### If you want to learn more about me, visit my strawpage! It's the best looking site, and the text is easier to read because it's in relatively broken up chunks. 

>[!NOTE]
*(By the way, it's been created with my default zoom set to 80%, so it will look better if you set your zoom to 80% to read it! And also, I don't know how it looks on mobile! If you're on mobile, my patreon or rentry are still available to read. Sorry, and thanks for understanding!)*
