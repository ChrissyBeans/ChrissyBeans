# *<p align=center>* **Hey there! || *I'll work on this at some point I prommy lol***

### ***<p align=center>Welcome to my github. There's nothing super important here, tbh. But here's a short intro rq.***

---

<p align=center> .

### *<p align=center>* [Sign my strawpage, made specifically for being a guestbook!](https://chrispybeans.straw.page/) I'll add interests and stuff to it soon so you can draw smth from said interest lol. idk shrugs
#### *<p align=center>* Whoever drew that damselfly (assuming it was someone here on pt and not from explore) ily. 

<p align=center> .

*<p align=center>* I'm Chrissy, I'm 21, I go by [she](https://en.pronouns.page/@Chrissybeans) [^1] // [her](https://pronouns.cc/@Chrispybeans) [^2] pronouns. Any are probably okay, but I'm not sure yet. I'm demiaroace/pan. Taken by My Cowboy (QPR <3)

<p align=center> .

<p align=center> I'm frequently offtab or not paying attention, so whisp to interact / get my attention most of the time. My status is always set to away! You gotta try interacting to see if I'm there. Also I make frequent use of tonetags as you can see. If you genuinely want me to not use them, you gotta tell me, and my memory is bad so you may have to remind me more than once, sorry. I'm friendly!! I'm just awkward/shy. If you approach me kindly I will return it! And if you're friends with the people I sit with, you can C+H with me, even if I don't know you! All green names are welcome to sit with me !

<p align=center> .

*<p align=center>* Please stop eating my fruit if I have any in general. /lh

*<p align=center>* **__Do not try to friend me if we didn't talk beforehand, I will not accept it.__**

*<p align=center>* The most basic DNI I have is basic [DNI](https://dni-criteria.carrd.co/) criteria. If I'm on the safe server, minors limit interaction unless friends.<sup> I will be friendly if you compliment me but I am not really looking to make friends with y'all. I am an adult!</sup> 

### *<p align=center>* **__If you accuse people of faking DID/OSDD just by virtue of being on here, don't talk to me. We will not get along, I already do not like you.__**

*<p align=center>* I will block any proship/profic on sight! I will not insult you or tell you to die, but I *do **not*** want to interact with you. Also spitting on me will earn you an immediate, very unkind fuck off and a permanent block if you are a stranger. For the rest of my DNI, please visit my full dni either of my sites listed.

<p align=center> I hide freely. If I have you or a friend hidden, it's likely for a reason. Please understand.

**<p align=center> Note ahead of time: I don't mind at all if you try to int when I have dniuf in my name, just be mindful that I may not be in the mood to talk to people I don't know! *But* if you interact *solely* to mock me, don't whine about it if I tell you to fuck off. If your sole purpose is to antagonize me, I will absolutely curse you out and block you. I don't care if you think it's :sparkles:valid:sparkles: or not, seeing a boundary and choosing to push it because you personally view it as invalid is a dick move.**

### *<p align=center>* Please visit either of the sites listed to learn more about me. New rentry and strawpage will be available when they're done.

>[!NOTE]
*(By the way, my pages have been created with my default zoom set to 80%, so things may be bigger for you than they are for me! Sorry, and thanks for understanding!)*

<p align=center> thank you very much to these two idiots who whispered me after to mock me because they ate my grapes /sar

*<p align=center>* ![ID: A cropped picture of a black textbox with pink text. There are two separate messages showcased, both sent at 7:27pm. The top message, from someone named Jophar, reads: your grapes were delicious. The bottom message, from someone named ahÃ³s-pagnÃ©m, reads: I eat.

<p align=center> I also want you to know that if you hate hh/hb to such an extreme that you'd tell other people to die over it, you should DNI and grow up. It's fine to not want the fandoms to interact, I won't bregrudge you that. But if you take it to the point you'd tell people to die about it, then like.... idk grow and mature because good god you will need it. This is also extremely directed at that one loser who got so angry upon seeing my friends in hh/hb avatars that he said he'd become the next hitler for hh/hb fans. And when I called him a dorkass for that because that's.... *checks notes* a really fucking stupid and unnecessary thing to say, he told me to kill myself. 
  
<p align=center> Anyways if you would genuinely tell people to kill themselves over hh/hb DNI I am actually so serious. I do not care for her media but jesus christ that's so unnecessary. Also the block button is literally RIGHT THERE like jesus fucking christ ðŸ˜­ And if you have reached the block limit then there's this magical thing called... ignoring them! Like holy shit it is not that hard. Anyways no this is not directed at your everyday hh/hb disliker, only at those who would take this extreme.
