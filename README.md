*<p align=center>* ![Gif description: A gif, featuring a black background with many small, colorful neon stars. The stars are not full shapes, only outlines. They all drift slowly downwards, at a 45 degree angle. They pop into sight and fade out. They all spin, either quickly or slowly, while changing color over the course of their time in view. They are of varying sizes, some bigger while others are much smaller. There is a sort of depth to the gif, as there appear to be multiple layers, with some sorts being farther away from the camera.

#### *<p align=center>* I am a chronic offtabber and idler, keep that in mind.

<p align=center> Please no ship interactions for the love of god
  
*<p align=center>* If I'm sitting completely on top of someone I'm likely completely unaware! Whisper me if you're not sure, I don't bite.

<p align=center> I block freely, so it's rarely ever personal. It could be for stuff like me not liking your vibe, me not liking something you said, etc. I'm free to curate my experience, so uhhh... sorry if that makes you mad ig. Also I'm a self/yumeshipper and if you dislike that then like, kindly go away. 
  
*<p align=center>* Sorry, but top right spawn wall is where I sit all the time. I won't move for you when I next spawn in. I'll only go anywhere for my friends. If I happen to not be at spawn, I'm likely sitting with Wesker and Mary.

#### *<p align=center>* I genuinely cannot believe this needs explaining but for the love of god don't make it weird if me and my friends are sitting together. Not everything needs to have a romantic connotation or reasoning you freak /dir. This also includes being weird to me/my friend if I'm sitting with an introject or fictionkin whose source happens to be my f/o. If you get weird about it I will immediately block you.
### *<p align=center>* Also by the way, if you get mean with my system friends for their sources I can assure you I will immediately become hostile. (Ex: bullying my friend Jim for source). They're not the same person as source, so you better know how to use your damn brain because I will fucking bite you.

##### *<p align=center>* If you're weird about systems I'm blocking you. I'm so sick of you people being weird about it.
